## Acknowledgments
As always, thanks to the great [Kevin Powell](https://www.twitter.com/KevinJPowell) for a wealth of guidance, tips, and tricks for all things HTML and CSS, including this bit of CSS to easily hide content that's meant for accessibility purposes only. I use this all the time.

```css
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border: 0;
}
```
